## 1. Overview

This directory contains the Dockerfile for building a Megatron-LM container image optimized for distributed training on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## 2. Contents

- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for Megatron-LM with all dependencies
- Built on NVIDIA PyTorch NGC image (25.03-py3)
- Includes NeMo Framework Launcher for advanced training configurations
- Pre-configured with Mellanox DOCA and networking tools
- Optimized for RDMA and InfiniBand networking

## 3. Included Components

### Base Image

- **NVIDIA PyTorch**: 25.03-py3 with CUDA 12.4+ support
- **Python**: 3.10+ with optimized PyTorch installation

### Training Frameworks

- **Megatron-LM**: Latest stable version with GPT training support
- **NeMo Framework Launcher**: 24.12 for advanced model configurations
- **Transformer Engine**: For optimized attention mechanisms

### Networking & Performance

## 4. Build Process

The image is automatically built and published via GitHub Actions when changes are made to the Dockerfile. The workflow file is located at:

```
.github/workflows/build_megatron_image.yaml
```

### Manual Build

To build the image manually:

```bash
docker build -t megatron-lm:latest .
```

### Published Image

The image is automatically published to:

```
ghcr.io/azure/ai-infrastructure-on-azure/megatron-lm:latest
```

## 5. Image Capabilities

### Supported Training

- **GPT models**: 125M to 175B+ parameters
- **Distributed training**: Tensor and pipeline parallelism
- **Mixed precision**: FP16 and BF16 training
- **Gradient checkpointing**: Memory optimization
- **ZeRO optimization**: Distributed optimizer states

### Dataset Support

- **SlimPajama**: 627B token cleaned dataset
- **Custom datasets**: JSON Lines format support
- **Data preprocessing**: Tokenization and binary format conversion
- **Streaming**: Efficient data loading from remote storage

### Hardware Optimization

- **Multi-GPU**: Up to 8 GPUs per node

- **CPU optimization**: Optimized for ND-series Azure VMs

## 6. Health Checks

The image includes health checks to verify:

- CUDA availability and GPU detection
- PyTorch installation and GPU access
- Basic import functionality for all frameworks

## 7. Usage Examples

### Basic Training

```bash
docker run --gpus all ghcr.io/azure/ai-infrastructure-on-azure/megatron-lm:latest \
  python /megatron-lm/pretrain_gpt.py --help
```

### Environment Check

```bash
docker run --gpus all ghcr.io/azure/ai-infrastructure-on-azure/megatron-lm:latest \
  python -c "import torch; print(f'GPUs: {torch.cuda.device_count()}')"
```

### Interactive Session

```bash
docker run -it --gpus all ghcr.io/azure/ai-infrastructure-on-azure/megatron-lm:latest bash
```

## 8. Environment Variables

The following environment variables are pre-configured:

- **LAUNCHER_VERSION**: 24.12
- **NEMO_VERSION**: 24.05
- **MEGATRON_LM_VERSION**: 878d65f

## 9. Working Directory

The container's working directory is set to `/megatron-lm` for easy access to training scripts.

## 10. Security

The image is configured for secure operation in Kubernetes environments:

- Non-root user capability (when not requiring privileged access)
- Minimal attack surface with only required packages
- Regular security updates via automated builds
